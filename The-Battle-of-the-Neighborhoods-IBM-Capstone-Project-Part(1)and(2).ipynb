Of course, there are alternatives to achieve the answer using available Google and Social media tools, but I thought digging more into the raw data of the state would be rewarding as it would give me a clear picture of what i might face with decision."

With venue information, it would  be easy to find out more information about the neighborhoods. For example, how many sports bars and restaurants there are, and any basketball courts or playgrounds? We could also need to find out about any banks and food and drink shops? It would better comprehend or settle on good choice about where to move or migrate to if this data was accessible.\n",

    "Subsequently, the reason for this project is to, algorithmically, find a way to use the location coordinates and tag each data point into a neighborhood in **two Counties in North Carolina-Wake County and Mecklenburg County**. The algorithm used is k-means clustering. The main idea is to determine neighborhood with venues clustered around each other so that one can make a decision on the right neighborhood to chose based on the proximity of amenities and venues to each other."
